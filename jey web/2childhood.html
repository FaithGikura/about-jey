    <h2>Memorable Childhood Experiences</h2>
    <p>During my childhood, I had the privilege of experiencing many memorable moments that shaped who I am today.My childhood games were really enjoyable.When I went to visit my grandparents upcountry we would pluck tea leaves,climbing the hills and building toys. </p>

    <p>Family played a crucial role in my upbringing. I have fond memories of my family. We usually have this family together events where we perform team building activities.This has helped our family to have a strong bond and unity.Seeing this togetherness makes me admire to bring up such a family also.</p>

    <p>These formative moments not only brought joy but also taught me valuable life lessons. They instilled in me patience,thanksgiving,love and patience.My parents always correct me when am wrong and that has helped me develop good morals.As the saying goes spare the rod spoil the child.I have to agree that being punished is painful,brings alot of anger sometimes but even though sometimes it seems as if our parents don't care its just their love language.</p>
